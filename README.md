This repository will aid me in learning the concepts of machine learning.

These are the steps I am taking in order to learn 'machine learning':

1. Review Python fundamentals and how to code in a different language (coming from JavaScript and C++)
   - AlgoExpert and LeetCode questions will help me build up my proficiency, and will be uploaded to this repository
2. Review the math required for machine learning, which includes calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory
   - This part will not be in the repository, just my own personal notes
3. Learn the basic concepts of machine learning through online instructors before I take the courses at college
   - It is currently January 12, 2025, I will take two machine learning courses starting in February
4. Study hard and complete the two classes 'Intro to Machine Learning' and 'Algorithms in Decision Making' in the spring
   - Professor Mandery and Professor Davila will be teaching these courses, and I am excited to learn from them
