This repository will aid me in learning the concepts of machine learning.

These are the steps I am taking in order to learn 'machine learning':

1. Review Python fundamentals and how to code in a different language (coming from JavaScript and C++)
   - Coding interview questions that I have completed will be here to record my progress
2. Review the math required for machine learning, which includes calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory
   - This part will not be in the repository, just my own personal notes
3. Learn the basic concepts of machine learning through online instructors before I take the courses at college
   - It is currently January 12, 2025, I will take two machine learning courses starting in February
4. Study hard and pass the two classes 'Intro to Machine Learning' and 'Algorithms in Decision Making'
   - Professor Mandery and Professor Davila will be teaching these courses, I am excited to learn from them!
